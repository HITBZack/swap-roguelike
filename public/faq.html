    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <p><strong>What is a run?</strong><br/>A run is a sequence of stages through a biome (or several biomes). When you press "Start Run", your current equipped items are snapshotted into the run and you push forward until you run out of lives or end the run.</p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>Do I lose items on death?</strong><br/>No. Your account inventory is permanent. Dying in a run never deletes items from your inventory, and equipped items are not consumed. A run only affects the temporary copy of your loadout that was snapshotted at the start.</p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>How do I get items permanently?</strong><br/>Any item that shows up in your Inventory is already permanent. During runs, some bosses can offer a "Save Selected Item" popup that lets you send one of your current run items back into your account inventory. Once an item is in inventory, you can equip it again on future runs.</p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>What does Blessing do?</strong><br/>Blessed items count as having doubled stacks for that run (for example, 1 blessed stack behaves like 2 normal stacks). Blessing is run-scoped: it makes items stronger during the current run but does not change your permanent inventory.</p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>What is Intro mode?</strong><br/>New players start in a guided intro biome with a fixed sequence of stages (some fights, some choices, a miniboss, and a boss). Beating the intro boss finishes intro mode for your account; future runs use the normal, more varied stage plans.</p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>How do I enable Auto-Play?</strong><br/>Above the game arena there is an Auto-Play toggle and a progress bar. Turn the toggle on to let the game automatically advance stages for you on a timer. You can switch it off at any time if you want to play manually.</p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>Can I trade items with other players?</strong><br/>Yes. You can open the Trade panel from the main UI, pick a friend, and propose trades when both of you are online. The system will prevent you from finalizing trades with offline players to keep things consistent.</p>
